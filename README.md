# google-kotlin-compose-course

### What is this?

This is an attempt at learning mobile development using Kotlin, by coding along to Google.

The app is no more than a composition of a few Compose elements to make a card that says Happy
Birthday to me.
Very uninspiring, and possibly not belonging in version control, but I would like to look back on
the first app I ever write with Kotlin, uninspiring as it is.

### Why, and why Kotlin?

I am looking for alternative criteria to develop user interfaces, and I figure I could explore
native development. Kotlin looks like a good first bet for someone like me who:

- likes code that looks as simple as possible
- likes strongly typed programming languages
- likes languages that have application across board - from web UI, native UI, right on to server
  development
- likes programming languages that promise to have value beyond the next few weeks. Or years.
